# weather-app
Designed and built a weather app that allows you to decide whether you need to wear a sweater at a glance. You set your "sweater weather" (the temperature you usually begin to wear a sweater at) and the background color of the day your checking out the weather for turns blue if the temperature is at or below what you dictate is your sweater weather. Name still pending..
